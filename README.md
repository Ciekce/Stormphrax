A work-in-progress UCI chess and [chess960] engine, with NNUE evaluation trained from zero knowledge starting with random weights.

The Stormphrax project prides itself on using self-generated training data for its networks, and will never use data generated by a third party.

This project is a continuation of my HCE engine [Polaris].

## Strength
At the time of writing, Stormphrax 7.0.0 is the strongest standard chess and Chess960 engine in the UK, and the 4th strongest Chess960 engine in the world.  
If this is no longer true, it is likely to have been overtaken by the excellent [Viridithas].

## Builds
`vnni512`: requires BMI2, AVX-512 and VNNI (Zen 4/Cascade Lake-SP/Rocket Lake and up)  
`avx512`: requires BMI2 and AVX-512 (primarily for Skylake-X and some Zen 4 machines)  
`avx2-bmi2`: requires BMI2 and AVX2 and assumes fast `pext` and `pdep` (i.e. no Bulldozer, Piledriver, Steamroller, Excavator, Zen 1, Zen+ or Zen 2)  
`avx2`: requires BMI and AVX2 - primarily useful for pre-Zen 3 AMD CPUs back to Excavator

If in doubt, compare the `avx2-bmi2` and `avx2` binaries and pick the one that's faster. BMI2 will always be faster on Intel CPUs.

Alternatively, build the makefile target `native` for a binary tuned for your specific CPU (see below)  

### Note:  
- If you have an AMD Zen 1 (Ryzen x 1xxx), Zen+ (Ryzen x 2xxx) or Zen 2 (Ryzen x 3xxx) CPU, use the `avx2` build even though your CPU supports BMI2. These CPUs implement the BMI2 instructions `pext` and `pdep` in microcode, which makes them unusably slow for Stormphrax's purposes.

## Building
Requires Make and a competent C++20 compiler that supports LTO. GCC is not currently supported, so the usual compiler is Clang. MSVC explicitly does not work.
```bash
> make <BUILD> CXX=<COMPILER>
```
- replace `<COMPILER>` with your preferred compiler - for example, `clang++` or `icpx`
  - if not specified, the compiler defaults to `clang++`
- replace `<BUILD>` with the binary you wish to build - `native`/`vnni512`/`avx512`/`avx2-bmi2`/`avx2`
  - if not specified, the default build is `native`
- if you wish, you can have Stormphrax include the current git commit hash in its UCI version string - pass `COMMIT_HASH=on`

By default, the makefile builds binaries without profile-guided optimisation (PGO). To enable it, though I do not measure a speedup from it, pass `PGO=on`. When using Clang with PGO enabled, `llvm-profdata` must be in your PATH.

## Credit
Stormphrax makes use of the following libraries:
- a slightly modified version of [Pyrrhic] for tablebase probing, licensed under the MIT license
- a slightly modified version of [incbin] for embedding neural network files, under the Unlicense
- [Zstandard] for decompressing NNUE files, under GPLv2 (see [COPYING](src/3rdparty/zstd/COPYING))
- [{fmt}][fmtlib] for convenient printing and string formatting

Stormphrax is tested on [this OpenBench instance][ob] - thanks to all the people there, SP would be much weaker without your support :3

In no particular order, these engines have been notable sources of ideas or inspiration:
- [Viridithas]
- [Svart]
- [Stockfish]
- [Ethereal]
- [Berserk]
- [Weiss]
- [Koivisto]

Stormphrax's current networks are trained with [bullet]. Early networks were trained with [Marlinflow].

The name "Stormphrax" is a reference to the excellent [Edge Chronicles][edge-chronicles] :)
